Microcode:

  if/else

  Some sort of MOV, but how to define?
  
  dst <- src    overwrite contents of dst with contents of src
                all bitv must have readable/writable attributes
    
    would it be easier to define mov like this instead?
    
    mov1(dst, src)
    mov8(dst, src)
    mov16(dst, src)
    
    or
  
    mov(dst, src, bitcnt)
